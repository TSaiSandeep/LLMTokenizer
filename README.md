# LLM Tokenizer

## Overview
Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units, called tokens, which can be words, subwords, or characters, depending on the tokenizer type. Large Language Models (LLMs) use tokenization as a fundamental step in processing and understanding text. Tokenization ensures that text input is converted into numerical representations that the model can process effectively. This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates LLM tokenization techniques, helping users understand how text is transformed before being processed by an LLM.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install Jupyter Notebook

If Jupyter is not installed, install it using:
```pip install notebook```

To update Jupyter Notebook:
```pip install --upgrade notebook```

### 2. Start Jupyter Notebook

Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
```jupyter notebook```

This will open Jupyter in your browser, where you can run the `LLM_Tokenizer.ipynb` notebook.

## Repository Contents
- `LLM_Tokenizer.ipynb` - The main notebook for tokenization.
- `README.md` - This file, providing instructions for setup and usage.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests to improve the tokenizer or add new features.
